 Operation XML language reference manual
 ========================================

Document version: 0.0.1

Structure:
-----------
The root element of the XML file have to be "operation-processor-script" and there
are 3 sections that are being processed if available: substitutions, definitions
and actions.

1. Substitutions
-----------------
The substitutions can define either vendor substitutions or substitutions of the
constant values. The type of substitution is being determined by it's type and the
syntax of the element is:

 <subst type="type" value="original-value">substitution-value</subst>

e.g.:

 <subst type="vendor" value="GenuineIntel">Intel</subst>

defines that "GenuineIntel" can be referred to as "Intel" too. This definition also
specifies it's a vendor type so when it's being read from the CPUID the value is
being converted to "Intel" for further reference. Likewise:

 <subst type="const" value="REGISTER">0x111</subst>

allows you to use keyword "REGISTER" in the function or action XML block to represent
value 0x111. The keyword will be converted into it's numeric equivalent once it's
required.

2. Definitions
---------------
The definitions block can define several definitions for various vendors as functions.
The function to return the resulting temperature value have to carry name of "getTemp"
with result type of int.

The function can be defined by a name and returnType where returnType should be only
"int" however "uint32_t" is supported as well.

The functions themselves can read the data using the special accessor elements like
dev or reg to define either device (only PCI devices are supported right now) or a
register to be read from the CPU (MSR register), PCI device (that have to be assigned
a variable using the dev element first) or from a CPUID.

All the decimal values can be defined both in decimal notation and hexadecimal notation.
For hexadecimal notation the "0x" prefix is required, e.g. 0x10 to define decimal number
16 etc.

The function elements can be: dev (PCI-only), reg, write-reg, op, flagIf, dump, reset,
                              returnIf, setIf, return, call, conditionBlock

2.1 Device element
-------------------

The device element (<dev>) is used to define the device and assign a handle to a device.
Currently only PCI devices are being supported by this app and you have to compile
the app with libpci support, i.e. pciutils and pciutils-devel packages have to be
installed to allow this to work.

The definition is as follows:

<dev type="device-type" value="device-class, device-vendor-id, device-function">handle</dev>

The handle returned can be used later by the <reg> element to read the PCI register. The
device is being closed automatically when the function returns.

2.2 Register element
---------------------

The register element (<reg>) is used to read the register information from the PCI device
(previously assigned by <dev> element), CPUID or CPU (MSR) register.

Type of the register read function can be one of following values: msr, cpuid, pci, pci-long,
								   pci-word, pci-byte

The "pci" type is the equivalent of "pci-long" (which is typically 4 bytes register). The
"pci-word" defines the 2 bytes wide register and "pci-byte" defines one byte wide register.

Syntax:
<reg type="type" value="register-or-handle, register">value</reg>

The register (for CPUID and/or MSR) or handle (if type contains "pci") will be accessed and
the read value will be saved into the "value" local variable.

Example usage:

<reg type="pci-byte" value="handle, 0x111">value</reg>

If you want to use substitution constant instead of the direct declaration it's supported too.
Imagine you have the substitution from the section 1 defined in your substitutions section,
i.e. you have "<subst type="const" value="REG">0x111</subst>". Now you can use the definition
like:

<reg type="pci-byte" value="handle, REG">value</reg>

and the result will be the same as in the previous case (with 0x111).

2.3 Arithmetical operations
----------------------------

The operations elements (<op>) is used to perform arithmetical operations on the data. It's
the core of the whole system allowing the most important mechanisms for calculating the
temperature from the registers since the values read are *never* the raw temperature data
values.

The syntax is:

<op type="type" value="sourceValue, arithmeticFunctionArgument">destinationValue</op>

where type can be one of following and the following formulas apply:

(note that "arithmeticFunctionArgument" is abbreated as arg, "sourceValue" as src and
"destinationValue" as dest)

type      => operation
-------------------------
and       => (dest = (src & arg))
or        => (dest = (src | arg))
eq        => (dest = (src == arg))
neq       => (dest = (src != arg))
greater   => (dest = (dest > arg))
lower     => (dest = (dest < arg))
shr       => (dest = (dest >> arg))
shl       => (dest = (dest << arg))
add       => (dest = (dest + arg))
subtract  => (dest = (dest - arg))
multiply  => (dest = (dest * arg))
divide    => (dest = (dest / arg))

Also inversions (~x) are allowed to unset bits, e.g.

... x = 0 ...
<op type="and" value="x, 1">
... x = 1 ...
<op type="and" value="x, ~1">
... x = 0 ...

2.4 Writing to the registers
-----------------------------

The <write-reg> element is designed for writing to the registers of the PCI device for
the purposes it's needed (like for purpose of AMD K8 board). The types of pci, pci-long,
pci-word and pci-byte are supported as well as for the PCI register read using the <reg>
element.

The syntax is:

<write-reg type="type" value="handle, REG">value</write-reg>

For this element the value is not the value to be written to but the value to read the
source data from to be written into the REG register of the PCI device defined by handle.

2.5 Conditional flag
---------------------

The system allows you to set the flag conditionally based on the input data using the
<flagIf> element. The expression in there is being evaluated and the flag named flagName
is being set if applicable.

Syntax:

<flagIf type="type" value="sourceValue, arithmeticFunctionArgument">flagName</flagIf>

The definition of type, sourceValue and arithmeticFunctionArgument is the same as for
arithmetic operations defined in section 2.3. If the value is bigger than 0 the flag
flagName is being set otherwise nothing is being done.

2.6 Conditional return
-----------------------

If you want to return from the function under some conditions (e.g. a flag is set) you
may use the <returnIf> element. The condition check part have the same syntax and
definition as the one in arithmetic operations section (section 2.3) and the returnValue
is being returned as a return value is this is being met.

<returnIf type="type" value="sourceValue, arithmeticFunctionArgument">returnValue</returnIf>

2.7 Conditional set
--------------------

This value is almost the same as conditional flag except instead of flagName the variableName
with a value should be defined.

<setIf type="type" value="sourceValue, arithmeticFunctionArgument">value=10</setIf>

This sets the local variable value to 10 if it's being met.

2.8 Reset element
------------------

If you're running a lot of arithmetical operations you most likely have many flags and variables
set. Since it requires some memory to do those operations you may need to reset those flags or
variables and deallocate the memory used by them. This can be done by the <reset> element.

Syntax:

<reset type="type" value="value" />

The type can be either flags, uint64 or int which determines what kind of variable you need to
reset. For value you can use either the comma-separated list of given type variables to be unset
or you can use keyword "all" to unset all of them if you don't need them.

2.9 Return element
-------------------

If you want to return some value from a function unconditionally you should use <return> element.
Normally, every function should be using this element right before the function closing element.

Syntax:

<return value="value" />

This returns the value from the function and terminates the function. The value is now being
stored as the function return value global variable.

2.10 Call element
------------------

If you want to get some data from the other function or print a variable (e.g. for debugging)
you may use the <call> element with appropriate type value.

Types supported: call, print

Syntax:
<call type="type" value="value-or-function-name">format-string-or-value-to-store-func-return</call>

Call example:

<call type="call" value="getValue">valueFromFunction</call>

This saves the result of getValue function into the valueFromFunction local variable.

Print example:

<call type="print" value="value">Value is 0x%x</call>

For print function call the format string is the same like for printf() C-language function.

2.11 Condition block
---------------------

Simply put the <conditionBlock> element is an "if-element" with type and value equivalent to the
arithmetic operations and if it's being evaluated as true, i.e. value is bigger than 0, the
block is being processed. The block can contain every element as the entire function itself.

The following example will run only when run is set to 1 (or flag run set) and if it enters
the block it's reading the CPUID 0x00000000 (here it's defined in a decimal notation, i.e.
decimal value 0) and stores the result into the ax variable. The arithmetic operation of
ax & 0x20 is being saved into the haveMSR variable and this value is being returned from the
function to identify it's having the MSR or not.

...
<conditionBlock type="eq" value="run, 1">
	<reg type="cpuid" value="eax, 0">ax</reg>
	<op type="and" value="ax, 0x20">haveMSR</op>
	<return value="haveMSR" />
</conditionBlock>
...

2.12 Dump element
-------------------

If you want to dump the information about the substitutions in the memory, variables, flags, function
results or pci-devices you can use the <dump> element to dump those variables.

Types supported: subst, vars, flags, function-results, pci-devices

Syntax:

<dump type="type" />

For the valid pci-devices the BDF of the device being loaded and vendor/product ids are being printed.
